大学英语3 期末口语试题 6G (1)

_Section 1 Read the paragraphs below_

With 6G going up to terahertz frequencies, there will be tremendous (巨大的)challenges in building new hardware as well, the researchers say. Better semiconductor technologies will also be needed for faster devices. Other challenges remain as well, including power consumption.

With frequency bands moving up in the hundreds of gigahertz, “even fundamental things like circuits and substrates to develop circuits are extremely tricky,” says Tataria. “So getting all those things right, and going from the fundamental-level details all the way up to building a system is going to be substantially harder than what it first came across.” Their study, therefore, attempts to explore the trade-offs involved in each futuristic technology.

_Section 2 Answer the following questions_

1. What challenges might the development of 6G technology face in the future？

2. How will 6G change your life?

_Section 1 Read the paragraphs below_

Another promising possibility the study teases involves what they call a haptic Internet. “We believe that a variety of sensory experiences may get integrated with holograms,” the authors write. “To this end, using holograms as the medium of communication, emotion-sensing wearable devices capable of monitoring our mental health, facilitating social interactions, and improving our experience as users will become the building blocks of networks of the future.”

Mischa Dohler, another co-author, believes that 6G will consolidate the “Internet of skills” or the ability to transmit skills over the internet. “We can do it with audio and video, but we can’t touch through the Internet…or move objects.” The consolidation of edge computing, robotics, AI, augmented reality and 6G communications will make this possible, he says. “This next generation Internet…will democratize skills the very same way as the Internet has democratized information.”

_Section 2 Answer the following questions_

1. How does 6G technology make a haptic Internet possible?

2. Take education as an example to explain what a “haptic Internet” bring to us.

大学英语3 期末口语试题 Chip (1)

_Section 1 Read the paragraphs below_

IBM has become the first in the world to introduce a 2-nanometer (nm) node chip. IBM claims this new chip will improve performance by 45 percent using the same amount of power, or use 75 percent less energy while maintaining the same performance level, as today's 7-nm-based chips. To give some sense of scale, with 2-nm technology, IBM could put 50 billion transistors onto a chip the size of a fingernail. The foundation of the chip is nanosheet technology in which each transistor is made up of three stacked horizontal sheets of silicon, each only a few nanometers thick and completely surrounded by a gate. Nanosheet technology is poised to replace so-called FinFet technology named for the fin-like ridges of current-carrying silicon that project from the chip’s surface.

_Section 2 Answer the following questions_

1. According to IBM, what advantages does the new chip have?

2. Why is chip industry important to the development of a country?

大学英语3 期末口语试题  Chip (2)

_Section 1 Read the paragraphs below_

The company anticipates that 2-nm node could potentially reduce the carbon footprint of data centers. It estimates that if every data center changed their servers to 2-nm-based processors, it could save enough energy to power 43 million homes. Closer to most of us is what IBM expects this to do our laptops and portable devices’ functions—including quicker processing in applications, easier language translation, and faster 5G or 6G connections. For those who find daily phone charging annoying, 2-nm node chips will quadruple cell phone battery life vs. 7-nm node chips, which the company says could require users to charge their devices only every third or fourth day, rather than every night. IBM also anticipates that this may impact autonomous cars by providing faster object detection and reaction.

_Section 2 Answer the following questions_

1. According to the paragraph, what are the potential benefits of 2-nm chips?

2. How can Chinese chip achieve technological breakthrough?

大学英语3 期末口语试题 AI (1)

_Section 1 Read the paragraphs below_

The research of LostGANs could eventually help robots and AI agents to better envision the results of future interactions with objects within their immediate environment. Such image generation based on reconfigurable layouts could also potentially help generate different visual scenarios that could help train autonomous vehicles.

And in the near-term, LostGANs could play the role of an educational tool that invites students and other curious learners to interact with AI through setting up a simple image layout. During a departmental open house, an early version of LostGANs attracted the attention of local high school students with its still imperfect AI-generated images.

_Section 2 Answer the following questions_

1. How would LostGANs benefit the training of autonomous vehicles?

2. Would you imagine and describe a scenario to illustrate how LostGANs can be used to improve quality of education in the near future?

大学英语3 期末口语试题  AI (2)

_Section 1 Read the paragraphs below_

AI has already shown off the capability to create photorealistic images of cats, dogs, and people’s faces that never existed before. More recently, researchers have been investigating how to train AI models to create more complex images that could include many different objects arranged in different poses and configurations.

The challenge involves figuring out how to get AI models—in this case typically a class of deep learning algorithms known as generative adversarial networks (GANs)—to generate more controlled images based on certain conditions rather than simply spitting out any random image. A team at North Carolina State University has developed a way for GANs to create such conditional images more reliably by using reconfigurable image layouts as the starting point.

_Section 2 Answer the following questions_

1. What is the challenge for GANs?

2. In your opinion, would AI-generated images replace human’s painting eventually? Why or why not?

大学英语3 期末口语试题  Robot (1)

_Section 1 Read the paragraphs below_

First off, kudos to that PR2 for still doing solid robotics research, right? And this research is definitely solid—--the fact that all of this stuff works as well as it does, perception, motion planning, grasping, high level strategizing, is incredibly impressive. Remember, this is 90 minutes of full autonomy doing tasks that are relatively complex in an environment that’s only semi-structured and somewhat, but not overly, robot-optimized. In fact, over five trials, the robot succeeded in the table setting task five times. It wasn’t flawless, and the PR2 did have particular trouble with grasping tricky objects like the spoon, but the framework that the researchers developed was able to successfully recover from every single failure by tweaking parameters and retrying the failed action. Arguably, failing a lot but also being able to recover a lot is even more useful than not failing at all, if you think long term.

_Section 2 Answer the following questions_

1. How do you comment on PR2’s performance?

2. What do you think the future prospect of service robots like PR2?

大学英语3 期末口语试题  Robot (2)

_Section 1 Read the paragraphs below_

While we’re focusing a little bit on the failures here, that’s really just to illustrate the exceptionally challenging edge cases that the robot encountered. Again, I want to emphasize that while the PR2 was not successful all the time, its performance over 90 minutes of fully autonomous operation is still very impressive. And I really appreciate that the researchers committed to an experiment like this, putting their robot into a practical environment doing practical tasks under full autonomy over a long period of time. We often see lots of incremental research headed in this general direction, but it’ll take a lot more work like we’re seeing here for robots to get real-world useful enough to reliably handle those critical breakfast tasks.

_Section 2 Answer the following questions_

1. Why does the author say PR2’s performance is “impressive”? Do you agree?

2. Which kind of robots are most appealing to you? Why?

大学英语3 期末口语试题 EV(1)

_Section 1 Read the paragraphs below_

Compared with some bargain-basement cars of the past—most notoriously, India’s star-crossed Tata Nano—the Wuling seems more engineered to modern standards. GM says 57 percent of the structure is made from high-strength steel. Anti-lock brakes, electronic brake-force distribution, ISOFIX rear child-safety restraints and ultrasonic rear-parking sensors are standard; but not the electronic stability control that’s been required on new cars in the U.S. and EU for several years, or an automated emergency braking system. While GM cites “16 rigorous safety tests” for the Wuling, it did not confirm whether the car could meet current crash-test standards in Western nations.

Westerners, or Tesla fans, might be tempted to scoff at the Wuling’s speck-sized body, glacial acceleration or limited range. But while the Wuling is too small to crack the size-obsessed American market, its philosophy may be instructive; especially for cities and nations looking to “microtransit” as a potential solution to traffic-clogged streets, emissions and urban quality-of-life issues.

_Section 2 Answer the following questions_

1. What are the advantages of Wuling mini?

2. What do you think are the advantages of EVs over fuel vehicles? Give specific examples.

大学英语3 期末口语试题 EV(2)

_Section 1 Read the paragraphs below_

Batteries remain by far the most expensive part of an EV, even as costs for lithium-ion cells have fallen toward $100 per kilowatt hour. Analysts say the battery in a typical electric family sedan can cost between $10,000 and $15,000—roughly double the price of the entire Wuling. So the Wuling creates a virtuous cycle: The smaller and lighter the car, the less battery it needs to deliver a given range. And a smaller battery itself weighs less. That keeps a lid on mass and costs, for automakers and consumers.

America, in fact, has an analog for the Wuling: The new electric Mini Cooper SE. In the current EV climate, obsessed with the range race to 300, 400 miles or more, the Mini’s 110-mile (177 km) driving range can make it seem as quaint as the Wuling. In some quarters, short-hop EVs are seen as a dead-end in design and market viability. But look again.

_Section 2 Answer the following questions_

1. How important are batteries to an EV?

2. What do you think are the disadvantages of EVs over a fuel vehicle (燃油车)?

大学英语3 期末口语试题  Aerospace(1)

_Section 1 Read the paragraphs below_

Stunningly, this is not unusual for Chinese space launches. China’s three main spaceports were built during the Cold War when security was paramount, with the U.S. and Soviet Union considering the possibility of preemptive strikes on facilities linked to China’s fledging nuclear weapon capabilities. Only the Wenchang launch center, established in 2016 for new rockets, is on the coast. As China has been aiming to launch as many as 40 or more times annually in the last few years, the issue is growing, with some stages falling on or near inhabited areas, including close to a school.

However where the stages fall and how they are dealt with is not as haphazard as it appears. The areas in which stages and side boosters fall are calculated to avoid major populations, and local warnings and evacuation orders are issued and implemented in advance. The array of amateur footage of falling rocket stages backs up the claim that the events are known and expected. No casualties from these events have so far been reported.

_Section 2 Answer the following questions_

1. What’s China’s problem in rocket launch mentioned in the above paragraphs?

2. What do you think the development of China's space industry will have on China or the world?

_Section 1 Read the paragraphs below_

Yet this approach is costly, disruptive and not without continued risks and occasional damage.

To mitigate and eventually solve the problem, the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp. (CASC), the country’s main space contractor is developing controllable parafoils to constrain the areas in which the stages fall, most recently tested on a Long March 3B launch from Xichang, southwest China, one of China’s workhorse launchers, which most frequently threaten inhabited areas. Grid fins, the kind which help guide Falcon 9 rocket core stages to landing areas, have been tested on smaller Long March 2C and 4B launch vehicles.

The latter step is part of attempts to develop rockets that can launch, land and be reused like the Falcon 9, thus controlling the fall of large first stages.

_Section 2 Answer the following questions_

1. What are the technologies used to solve the safety problem of rocket launching?

2. Why do human beings spare no efforts to explore the outer space?

  

大学英语3 期末口语试题  Cloud Computing (1)

_Section 1 Read the paragraphs below_

﻿How much of our computing now happens in the cloud? A lot. Providers of  public cloud services alone take in more than a quarter of a trillion U.S. dollars a year. That's why Amazon, Google, and Microsoft maintain massive data centers allaround the world. Apple and Facebook, too, run similar facilities, all stuffed with high-core-count CPUs, sporting terabytes of RAM and petabytes of storage.

These machines do the heavy lifting to support what's been called “surveillance capitalism": the endless tracking, user profiling, and algorithmic targeting used to distribute advertising. All that computing rakes in a lot of dollars, of course, but it also consumes a lot of watts: Bloomberg recently estimated that about 1 percent of the world's electricity goes to cloud computing.

_Section 2 Answer the following questions_

1. Why investment on data center is increasing?

2. What are the problems on current cloud computing?

  

大学英语3 期末口语试题  Cloud Computing (2)

_Section 1 Read the paragraphs below_

﻿Software and hardware engineering will no doubt reorient their design practices around power efficiency. More code will find its way into custom silicon. And that code will find more reasons to run infrequently, asynchronously, and as minimally as possible. All of that will help, but as software progressively eats more of the world—to borrow a now-famous metaphor—we will confront this challenge in ever-wider realms.

We can already spy one face of this future in the nearly demonic coupling of energy consumption and private profit that provides the proof-of-work mechanism for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Companies like Square have announced investments in solar energy for Bitcoin mining, hoping to deflect some of the bad press associated with this activity.

_Section 2 Answer the following questions_

1. According to the paragraphs above, what are the solutions that software and hardware engineering offer in order to solve the energy consumption problem on cloud computing?

2. What are the other possible ways to reduce the energy consumption of cloud computing?
