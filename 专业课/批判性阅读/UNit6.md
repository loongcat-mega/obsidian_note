Today I’ll narrate our group’s mindmap of Why Leaves Turn Color in the Fall.Autumn's vibrant foliage brings beauty to the world, but it also carries a deeper symbolism of death and decomposition. Let's explore the fascinating process behind the transformation of leaves.

Now,firstly,Where do the colors come from?All summer the sun feeds leaves so they can process sunlights.But,with the Fall comes,the tree begins pulling nutrients back into its trunk and roots,pares down and gradually chokes off its leaves,then the leaves stop producing the pigment chlorophyll and photosynthesis ceases.Then,Where can a tree go in winter?It survives by dropping its leaves ,by only a few fragile threads of fluid-carrying xylem hold leaves to their stems.

With the season by,the leaves’s change.They stay green at first,then,reveal spots of yellow and red as chlorophyll gradually breaks down.At last the leaves fall,as a leaf ages,the growth hormone auxin fades,and cells at the base of petiole divide,the leaves leave.

Now ,let’s unveiling the Science,first,Casesing of Photosynthesis，As days grow shorter and temperatures drop, trees stop producing chlorophyll, allowing other pigments to shine through.Second,Anthocyanins and Carotenes,Yellow and orange pigments take center stage when chlorophyll production diminishes, revealing the hidden beauty of autumn.And then,Aging of leaves,As the leaf ages,the growth hormone auxin fades,and cells at the base of petiole divide.

However,Disintegration not mean to vanish.Marvels the planet dished out every year,They shimmer with colors of sunset,spring flowers,and the shuddering pink of a blush.Sublime from  one beatifull state to another.Though they loss thire green life ,they bloom with urgent colors,as the woods grow mummifyied day by day,and Nature become more radiant.Protect the tender shoots and make a rich humus,A damp stucco-like mortar of semi-decayed leaves protectes the tender shots with a roof  until spring ,and makes a rich humus.

Plants are like this, and so are people.Embracing the Change Within,Just as trees shed their leaves to prepare for the rigors of winter, autumn reminds us of the importance of letting go and embracing the ever-changing nature of our own lives.

My report is over ,thanks your for your listen.
