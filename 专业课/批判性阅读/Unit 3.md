这篇文章由Alice Walker撰写，她是一个短片小说作家，出生在一个佃农家庭，由于家中孩子太多，导致作者没能得到父母太多照顾，在意外中失去了右眼，但多次参与民权运动 。在这篇文章中，作者对女儿吸烟的现象进行分析反思，使用因果分析法，得出烟草是使人上瘾的，但是这不并是烟草本身的错，而是那些滥用、遏制它本身天性的人的错。
首先作者就女儿吸烟的事进行分析，想到了自己因吸烟而去世的父亲，自从作者记事起作者父亲就开始吸烟，包括自己的姐妹，尝试戒烟但是却做不到，说明了吸烟是令人上瘾的。作者给出了好莱坞电影主角与烟草之间的代言，让父亲这样的深深痴迷，以及父亲让女儿吸烟等细节来证明这个观点。然后作者在烟草原产地见识到了当地人对烟草的态度：尊重以及崇拜，他们会将烟草用于治疗伤痛和治愈疾病，这种现象引起了作者的反思，我们为什么不能烟草本身的天性释放出来呢？作者根据现象进行因果分析，得出我们应该合理种植及正确使用烟草的结论。
我支持作者的吸烟是使人上瘾的观点，同时，我们应该合理使用烟草，比如用于治疗伤痛等。我们无法控制别人去戒烟，但是我们可以约束自己。

    This article was written by Alice Walker, a short-story writer who was born into a sharecropper's family. Due to the large number of children in her family, the author didn't receive much attention from her parents. She also lost sight of one eyes in an accident but was actively involved in the civil rights movement.In this article, the author conducts an Cause-and-Effect Analysis on the phenomenon of her daughter smoking, using a causal analysis approach. Finally,she concludes that tobacco is addictive, but it's not the fault of tobacco itself; it's the fault of those who misuse it and suppress its inherent nature.

    First, the author begins by analyzing the phenomenon of her daughter's smoking and reflects on her father, who passed away due to smoking. The author's father had been a smoker for as long as she at her daught age, as were her sisters, and they all tried to quit but couldn't, indicating the addictive  of smoking. The author provides examples of Hollywood movie hero and heroine endorsing tobacco, which deeply influenced her father and subsequently led to her daughter smoking.
Later in the article, the author shares her experiences in Native Americans, where local people hold a deep veneration and reverence for tobacco. They use it for healing wounds and curing diseases, which made the author ponder why we can't allow the natural properties of tobacco to release,we can liberate tobacco from who have captured and abused it,release it nature and freedom. Drawing from these observations, the author engages in a causal analysis, concluding that we should cultivate tobacco responsibly and use it correctly.

I wholeheartedly endorse the author's assertion that smoking is an addictive behavior. At the same time, it is paramount to emphasize the importance of using tobacco responsibly, especially in applications related to heal wounds and cure diseases. While we may not possess the ability to dictate or control others' choices when it comes to quitting smoking, we do have the power to exercise self-restraint and discipline within our own lives.

Supporting the author's perspective on the addictive nature of smoking, it is essential to consider the broader implications of this habit. Acknowledging the challenges that individuals face in overcoming their addiction, we should strive for a compassionate and understanding approach when dealing with those trying to quit smoking. Simultaneously, we should educate ourselves and others about the potential therapeutic benefits of tobacco when used in a responsible and regulated manner, such as in traditional medicine.
