《Why Marriages Fail》was written by Anne Roiphe ,who was an Ameracan feminist author，born in an afflent Jewish family,her father was an alcoholic and womanizer ,her mother was an abused wife.In this article,author analyzes  
the resons why marriages fail,not simply because of the outside weather but because the inner climate becomes too hot or too cold ,too turbulent or too stupefying.At the end of article,author emphasizes tthat if the partners can stay past the breaking up of the romantic myths into development of real love and intimacy,the have achieved a work as amazing as the greatest catthedrals of the world.

The assertion is devided into two parts,one is why marriages fail,the other one is how we achieve a great marriage.First,author describes current state of marriage, the condition of marriage in modern society, such as the increasing divorce rate and its impact on children.And challenges in Marriage,from cultural shifts to role transitions, these challenges test modern marriages.Following analyzes the outer and innner pressure, external pressures on marriage such as unemployment, illness, and infertility.Further,people choose partners based on childhood experiences and emotional patterns,so,author deems people will repeate past patterns,explains how people reproduce the emotions and experiences from their childhood in their marriages.Importantly,Infidelity , an affair can become a fatal blow to a marriage.Now how we achieve a great marriage?communication in marriage,which boots positive impact on the relationship,a man and a woman must be able to tell each othe how the feel and why they feel the way they do. Maintaining Individuality,achieve a balance between separateness and closeness is one of major tasks of all human beings at every stage of lif.Sacrifices Required in Marriage,not dereadul self-sacrifice of soul,but some level of compromise.

I support the author's point of view. It is the joint responsibility of two people to protect a eudaemonic marriage. Each party has responsibilities and obligations, although the responsibilities are different. Everyone in a marriage should maintain communication. Maintaining a sense of intimacy is a magic weapon to maintain a relationship, but it should not be too close.Must see each other as individuals, because being too close will lead to dependence on both parties.Have a spirit of sacrifice.And then,marriage that do not fail but improve!
